## Issue Reporting Etiquette

1. **Bugs relating to Crowdmap.com should contain steps to reproduce the problem as well as operating system, browser and browser version.** Screenshots can also be very useful to us. If you're an advanced user who knows what a JavaScript stacktrace is, providing that with your report will earn you much love.
2. **Bugs relating to Crowdmap's API should ideally provide a cURL request to reproduce the problem.** Be sure edit out your session and API keys; these are sensitive and should be be treated like passwords.
3. **Issues relating to Crowdmap's iOS or Android mobile clients or SDKs should be filed in their respective repos elsewhere on GitHub.**
4. **Feature requests should ideally come with a good use case.**
5. **All issues should be tagged appropriately.**
6. We do not use version numbers with New Crowdmap. **Issues should be tagged using the "ASAP", "Soon" and "Someday" pseudo-milestones** to indicate priority.
