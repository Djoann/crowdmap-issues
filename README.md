# Crowdmap Issues

Welcome! This repository's only purpose is for filing, tracking and discussing bugs and features in New Crowdmap's frontend, clients and API. Please do not use it for "Classic" issues.

**Before filing an issue** please search the database to ensure it hasn't already been reported.

If you desire, you can watch this repository to keep apprised on Crowdmap's development.

## Issue Reporting Etiquette

1. **Bugs relating to Crowdmap.com should contain steps to reproduce the problem as well as operating system, browser and browser version.** Screenshots can also be very useful to us. If you're an advanced user who knows what a JavaScript stacktrace is, providing that with your report will earn you much love.
2. **Bugs relating to Crowdmap's API should ideally provide a cURL request to reproduce the problem.** Be sure edit out your session and API keys; these are sensitive and should be be treated like passwords.
3. **Issues relating to Crowdmap's iOS or Android mobile clients or SDKs should be filed in their respective repos elsewhere on GitHub.**
4. **Feature requests should ideally come with a good use case.**
5. **All issues should be tagged appropriately.**
6. We do not use version numbers with New Crowdmap. **Issues should be tagged using the "ASAP", "Soon" and "Someday" pseudo-milestones** to indicate priority.
